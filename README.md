# Simple DHCP - Cisco Packet Tracer Lab
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file (`DHCP-Practical.pkt`) that demonstrates how to configure and test **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** in a small network.
---
## üìÇ File Included
- **DHCP-Practical.pkt** ‚Üí Packet Tracer file for DHCP server-client configuration.
---
## üìù Lab Overview
In this lab:
- A DHCP server is configured to automatically assign IP addresses to clients.
- Devices such as PCs, Switches, and Routers are connected in a simple topology.
- DHCP eliminates the need for manual IP configuration.
---
## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Run
1. Download and install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.0 or later recommended).

2. Clone this repository or download the `.pkt` file directly.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
or simply click Download ZIP.

3. Open DHCP-Practical.pkt in Packet Tracer.

4. Run the simulation and verify:
PCs receive IP addresses automatically.
DHCP leases are assigned properly.
